**Weeks**  
1. Introducing user experience design
2. Getting to know common terms, tools, and frameworks in UX design
3. **Joining design sprints**
4. Building a professional presence 

UX designers often participate in design sprints to define the direction of a product. In this part of the course, you'll explore the world of design sprints, including the phases of a design sprint and how to plan and participate in one. You'll also learn about retrospectives, which is a way to constructively reflect on a design sprint and identify areas of improvement to implement next time.

## Understand design sprints
### Introduction

Design sprint is a time-bound process with 5 phases typically spread out over 5 full, 8-hour days.

Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?
Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in?
Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint? 
If you answered yes to any one of these questions, a design sprint might be the right move.

### 5 phases of design sprints

Creative collaboration is at the core of every phase.
- **Understand phase:** 
Sets your sprint on the right track
Helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge
Learn from experts and different people from other departments and industries.
User first
- **Ideate phase:**
Coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions
Sketch and present their ideas
Start planning for user testing
Start recruiting users that fit your target profile now
- **Decide phase:**
Decide which solutions you want to build from potential solutions
- **Prototype phase:** 
Creating a step-by-step blueprint for your prototype
Ready to build the first version of your new app feature
Don't need a finished product, just something realistic enough to test with users
Confirming the test schedule
Finalizing interview questions
Making sure your prototype is good to go
- **Test phase:** 
Put your prototype in front of users
Bbserve how they react and then interview them about their experiences

### Benefits of design sprints
- It's all about the user 
- Value every person in room
- The best ideas rise to the top
- Time to focus 
- Lowes risk
- Versatile scheduling

Next, you need to identify the key deliverables, meaning what your team actually wants to create by the end of the sprint.

## Participate in
Let's do a quick recap of what we've covered so far. We've defined the design sprint, identified the five phases, and explored what goes into planning a successful sprint. Now you're probably thinking, "That's great, but where does a newbie UX designer like me fit into all of this?" As an entry-level UX designer, you won't be running the show, but you'll play an important role contributing to every phase of the sprint. 
Let's check out what your sprint week might look like:

- When you get to the sprint space, you'll find everything you need to do your work. You'll have office supplies, water to drink and maybe some snacks. 
- The sprint leader will welcome everyone and lay out some ground rules. For example, you might have to give up your phone and keep your laptop closed until the end of each day. 
- There might also be a team icebreaker, like the example mentioned earlier. 
- Once everyone is settled in, it's time to get started. 
- The first day is the **understand phase**, where you'll get a clear picture of the design challenge. There will be plenty of short talks by experts that are designed to inspire you. Make note of any thoughts you have. 
- Phase 2 is the **ideate phase**. The sprint leader will guide the team through brainstorming activities to spark creativity and generate many possible solutions to the design challenge. Your main focus is coming up with ideas and putting them out there. 
- Welcome to phase 3, the **Decide Phase**. Congratulations, you're halfway through the sprint. Your team will decide on the solution with the greatest chance of success. As a newbie UX designer, you'll get involved in every stage of the decision-making process. When potential solutions fight it out, you'll vote for the one you think has the most potential. As you might remember, at this point, you also need to start planning ahead for testing or phase 5 of the design sprint. As an entry-level UX designer, you might help by scheduling testers, creating survey or interview questions, and gathering necessary equipment. 
- Phase 4 is all about creating a **prototype** of your product. As an entry-level UX designer, you'll be actively involved in creating a solid prototype for users to try out. You'll ask questions, offer ideas, and review the completed prototype. You might also confirm the test users for phase 5. We've made it. It's test day. 
- The **test phase** is the final phase of the process where you put your prototype to the test. You might be asked to collect user feedback by observing and interviewing users. This feedback helps the team know what to revise before bringing the product to market and that's it. belly to get to work.

## Reflect on
The **retrospective** is a collaborative critique of the team's design sprint.

We usually do retrospective meetings immediately following the sprint so that everyone's thoughts are fresh. Retrospective meetings don't have any particular agenda. The goal is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has a chance to give feedback. The two key questions we aim to answer in the meeting are: "What went well?" and "What can be improved?" The person who led the sprint will guide the conversation, and someone will take notes so that the team can use the feedback to make the next sprint even more productive. Retrospectives are super useful. They can help you to work better as a team, improve how you communicate with clients, and even point out areas where you can grow as an individual. Retrospectives are all about empowering, not shaming. If something didn't go well, this is your chance to make sure you have the resources and the tools to do better next time
