hi, he is Michael.
- The phrase "user experience" was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman, as technology use expanded and evolved.
## Get to know user experience design
- The user experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.
- For a user to have a good experience, the product needs to be useable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.
- Interaction designers: focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.Focus less on how the product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.
- UX researchers: conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product.Answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this product easy to use? And, would people be interested in this new design feature? The goal of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users are having.
