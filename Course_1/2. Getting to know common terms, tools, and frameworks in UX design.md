## Talk like a UX designer
### Define the user, end user, and user experience
- user: Any person who uses a product.  
- end user: The specific audience a UX designer creates something for.  
- User experience: How user feel about interacting with or experiencing a  product.  

Evaluating user experience:
- Is the product easy to use? 
- Is the product equitable? 
- Does the product delight the user? 
- Does the product solve the user's problem?

As a UX designer, you will focus on the end user, acting as the user's advocate and balancing business needs. Keep the end user as your main priority. 
  
### Prioritize the user

User-centered design

User-centered design puts the user front and center. Focusing on the user means considering their story, emotions, and the insights you've gathered about them. 

Each phase of the user-centered design process focuses on users and their needs. It’s an iterative process, which means that designers go back to certain phases, again and again, to refine their designs and create the best possible product for their intended users.

- **Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.** You want to know how users will engage with your design, as well as the environment or context in which they’ll experience the product. Understanding this requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews, which we’ll explore more later.
- **Specify the user’s needs.** Based on your research, figure out which user problems are the most important to solve. 
- **Design solutions to those user problems.** Come up with lots of ideas for designs that can address the user problems you’ve identified. Then, start to actually design those ideas! 
- **Evaluate the solutions you designed against the user’s needs.** Ask yourself, “Does the design I created solve the user’s problem?” To answer this question, you should test the product you designed with real people and collect feedback.

Notice how the arrows in the diagram indicate circular movement. This illustrates the iterative quality of the user-centered design process. Designers go back to earlier phases of the process to refine and make corrections to their designs. With the user-centered design process, you’re always working to improve the user’s experience and address the problems that users are facing! 

## Think like a UX designer
A framework creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve. You could think of frameworks like outlines for a project.
### The five elements framework.
A framework of Steps a designer takes to turn an idea into a working product.
![](https://i.imgur.com/FoL0bfu.png)
- **Strategy:** Lay a foundation of your design goals. These goals are based on user needs and the business objectives.
- **Scope:** Determine what you’re building. Decide features and content to be included.
- **Structure:** Figure out how to organize your design and how you want users to interact with.
- **Skeleton:** Layout of the product. Details how your design works.
- **Surface:** The interface that users view and interact with.

### The design thinking framework.
A way to create solutions functional and affordable.
![](https://i.imgur.com/211M6OS.png)
- During the empathize phase, the goal is to understand users’ needs and how users think and feel. This involves a lot of user research, such as conducting surveys, interviews, and observation sessions, so you can get a clear picture of who your users are and the challenges they are facing.
- In the define phase, you’ll create a clear problem statement, or a description of the user’s need that your designs will address, based on your research findings. This will drive your team toward a clear goal for the design of the product.
- Once you land on a user problem and establish why it’s an important one to solve, it’s time for the ideate phase. The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible. 
- Once you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the prototype phase. A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality. 
- During the test phase, users provide feedback about your designs, before the product is built by engineers and launched to the public. You can use this feedback to make changes and improvements to your designs, as many times as you need.

### Lean UX
Focuses on reducing wasted time and resources, and producing a workable product as soon as possible, the process is iterative.
![](https://i.imgur.com/fVQh2Wq.png)
The Lean UX process encourages productivity and collaboration. Lean UX teams are typically cross-functional, which means you’ll be working alongside team members like engineers and UX researchers. 

Six principles you should keep in mind when using the Lean UX process: 
- **Move forward.** Focus only on design elements and features that move the design process toward a particular goal. Don’t get distracted by “nice-to-haves.” 
- **Stay curious.** Lean UX is about using feedback from users and stakeholders to revise and improve your designs. Continuously seek feedback to understand why specific design choices work or don’t work.
- **Test ideas in the real world.** Lean UX encourages designers to test their ideas - using prototypes, for example - outside of the conference room and with potential users.
- **Externalize your ideas.** Instead of internally debating and analyzing whether or not an idea is going to work, turn your ideas into something physical, viewable, and testable, while they’re still fresh in your mind. This way, you’ll get feedback on your designs in the early stages, when diverse perspectives and feedback are most helpful. 
- **Reframe deliverables as outcomes.** Focus on creating usable, enjoyable products that users actually want and need. Always keep in mind that you’re designing for your users first-and-foremost, not for the project stakeholders.  (??? What are you talking about???)
- **Embrace radical transparency.** Feel comfortable being honest with everyone on the team (and expect the same in return), since you will depend on each other’s insights. This way, everyone can make informed decisions about how to move forward and avoid wasting time and energy. 

The Lean UX process is all about staying open to constant feedback and revisions through collaboration.

## Consider the Next Billion Users
Globally there are a billion people right now just starting to use the internet? We call these folks the Next Billion Users, or NBU.

Break down the big issues NBU:
- Cost: Can't afford expensive.
- Connectivity: not have constant or unlimited access to the Internet
- Digital literacy: might not be familiar with certain design patterns,calls to action, or icons that we take for granted. 
- Literacy: not able to read or need to switch languages.

<br>


## Design across platforms
A platform is the medium that users experience your product on, such as desktop, mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, wearables, TVs, smart displays, and more. It's important to design with multiple platforms in mind, because users want a product to look and feel similar, no matter what platform they're using. 

UX designers now have to plan for a nearly infinite number of different devices and screen sizes. Even though UX designers need to think across platforms, it's important to focus on one platform first when you build a new product. The platform you select should be the one that best meets your end users' needs. Later, you can design for additional platforms. 

In addition to having a consistent user experience across platforms, it's also important to have a consistent **brand identity**. In this case, the brand identity refers to the visual appearance and voice of a company.

## Design for accessibility
![](https://i.imgur.com/rPpJIlm.png)

Three more ways to put the user first in your designs: 
- **Universal design:** 
Considering how to include an even broader range of people in their designs.
One-size-fits-all.
Didn't meet the needs of every user.
- **Inclusive design:** 
Take into account personal identifiers.
Making design choices that take into account **personal identifiers**.
Like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender.
Includes researchers and designers from traditionally excluded populations in the process.
Solve for one, extend to many.
Designing for people with disabilities is called **accessibility**.
Only benefits the **group** the design was created for and **existing users**.
Currently being excluded.
- **Equity-focused design:** 
One step further than Inclusive design.
Focus on designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored.
Goal is to uplift groups that have been excluded historically.
Provide different levels of opportunity and support for each person to achieve fair outcomes.
Who have been excluded in the past.

### Accessibility
a11y
4 big categories:
- motor disabilities
- deaf or hard of hearing
- cognitive disabilities
- vision disabilities
More than 1 billion people around the world have a disability. 
#### Social model of disability
Defines a disability as being caused by the way society is organized or how products are designed rather than a person's ability or difference.
#### disabilities
- Permanent
- Temporary
- Situational: (drive at night)

Inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged font.
Help everyone understand videos, like Closed Captions.

### Equity-focused design

### Assistive technology
AT
To describe any products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities. 
- Color modification: like high contrast mode or dark mode on a device
- Voice control
- Screen readers: reads out loud any on screen text 
- Alternative text: translate a visual user interface into a text-based user interface
